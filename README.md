# Kidney disease classsification

Welcome to the Kidney Disease Classification Web Application README! This project is designed to assist in the classification of kidney conditions using CT scanned images. The web application is capable of distinguishing between four major categories: cyst, normal, stone, and tumor. 

## Project Overview
The Kidney Disease Classification Web Application combines the power of machine learning and web development to provide a user-friendly and accessible tool for healthcare professionals and patients. Leveraging TensorFlow's Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, this application can analyze CT scanned images and provide real-time, multi-class classifications. 

## Key Features
Multi-Class Classification: The CNN model is trained to classify CT scanned kidney images into four classes: cyst, normal, stone, and tumor.

User-Friendly Interface: The Flask-based web application offers an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for users to upload their CT scans and receive classification results.

Real-Time Results: The application provides instant feedback, displaying the classification results and confidence scores.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the setup and installation instructions provided in the documentation. You'll need to set up the necessary environment, dependencies, and configure the Flask application.
